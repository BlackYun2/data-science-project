    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "*Regular Expressions* (a.k.a. `regex` or `regexp`) are a tool for working with and manipulating text data.  We've already done some text manipulation in this lab.  We've shied away from particularly thorny examples until now.  Using `python`'s string methods is useful, but that approach has it's limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions provide a set of rules for working with text data.  At first, these expressions look completely foreign (e.g. `([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+){3})`), but once you know some of the basics they're not so bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the fundamentals of regular expressions are based upon abstract algebra.  Mathematicians have studied regular expressions simply to lay down and understand their theoretical underpinnings.  We won't go anywhere near that level of detail.  For us, regular expressions will simply be used to process some gnarly text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key `regex` patterns and concepts that you must know and be comfortable with.  That fact is, there are many ways to create a `regex` to search for a particular pattern.  Some approaches are more succinct than others.  As with most things, you will get better the more you practice.  You should try to make your `regex` patterns as crisp as possible while still mainting readabilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some resources\n",
    "In order to become proficient with `regex`s, you are **strongly encouraged** to take the *RegexOne* tutorial at [https://regexone.com/](https://regexone.com/).  That tutorial is an interactive and accessible introduction to regular expressions.  It contains problems at the end to test your knowledge.  The *RegexOne* website also contains a very nice demo for `Python3`.  This lab will borrow from the *RegexOne* `python` demo to walk you through some concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to consider the book [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do) for more details as well as some historical comments.\n",

       "'Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.[18] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[19] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][20] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[21] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][23] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[24] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.[25]'"
